> An Intelligent personal assistant app which uses voice commands and location awareness to streamline your daily tasks and keep you on top of your schedule. AI smart contextual awareness notification system ensures that you won't need any other personal assistant after Cue, your new best assistant.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to use voice commands to manage tasks and access information, so I can be more productive.
- As a user, I want location-based reminders to stay on schedule and avoid missing important tasks.
- As a user, I want to manage my calendar with voice commands through the app, so I can keep my schedule organized hands-free.

### Admin Stories
- As an admin, I want to view user activity statistics to understand usage patterns, so I can make informed decisions about app improvements.
- As an admin, I want to view user feedbacks, so I can make app improvements based on user needs.
- As an admin, I want to get AI suggestions for possible app improvements based on user feedbacks

###  Cue is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that allows us to create and manage our app's data effectively.
- To send notifications, the app uses [Forebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) FCM supports Android, iOS, and the web, allowing us to send and receive messages reliably across platforms.
- The app uses the fonts ["MonomaniacOne"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Monomaniac+One) and ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the app.
